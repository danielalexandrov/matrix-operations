# Matrix Operations
this is a matrix operation library I'm building in pure C to refresh my skills in both C and linear algebra.  

## Currently supported features
- creating and deleting matrices
- multiplication of matrix with another matrix as well as a scalar
- addition and subtraction of matrices
- calculating the determinant of a 2x2 matrix

## Features on TODO list
- vectors and the corresponding functions (sum, difference, scaling)
- determinants of 3x3 and higher using Laplace expansion
- transposing a matrix

## General TODO list
- returning NULL instead of 0 matrix
